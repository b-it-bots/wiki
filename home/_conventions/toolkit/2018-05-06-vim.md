## Learning Materials

The creators of the cheatsheet also provide introductory slides to get you started and learn everything covered by the cheatsheet step-by-step.

[Vim Tips Wiki](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki) A big collection of useful vim-topics in wiki form. Good source of information to anything from basic stuff like keymappings to more specific vim-topics. Browse it directly or get flushed there during deep google-searches.

[Vim Awesome](https://vimawesome.com/) Site that advertises and describes basically all popular vim-plugins.

[Learn vimscript the hard way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/) If you want to get really deep down and dirty with vim, this is the way to go. The site teaches vimscript: The language used to customize vim. The .vimrc file uses vimscript to setup vim during start and pugins can be written in vimscript too.

## Installation

First of all make sure that vim is installed

```bash
sudo apt-get install vim
```

Copy the `.vimrc` file in this directory to your home directory as `.vimrc`. Assuming that you cloned this repository in your home folder you can do:

```text
cp ~/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc ~/
```

If it doesn't exist already, create a directory "autoload" inside `.vim`:

```text
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload
```

Go to that directory:

```text
cd ~/.vim/autoload
```

Download the plugin:

```text
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim -o plug.vim
```

Enter vim:

```text
vim
```

Install all plugins by calling PlugInstall inside vim

```text
:PlugInstall!
```

Once it's done installing the plugins, in your `.vimrc` file go to line 17 and uncomment it.

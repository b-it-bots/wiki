## First steps

* [Installing the required software](/setup/installing-requirements/)
* [Running the MAS software](/setup/running-mas-software)
* [Get a fork of our code base](/setup/forking-our-repos)

## Tutorials
Here is a list of useful tutorials to get you started:

### git
If you have never worked with git before, we recommend to go through the following basic git tutorial:

* [Git basics tutorial](http://excess.org/article/2008/07/ogre-git-tutorial/)
* [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
* [Managing merge conflicts](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts)
* [Git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

### ROS

If you have never worked with ROS before, we recommend to go through the [official beginner tutorials provided by ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

{% capture notice-text %}
In order to understand at least the different core components of ROS, you should cover Tutorials 1 to 7:
* Installing and Configuring Your ROS Environment
* Navigating the ROS Filesystem
* Creating a ROS Package
* Building a ROS Package
* Understanding ROS Nodes
* Understanding ROS Topics
* Understanding ROS Services and Parameters

However, it is highly recommended however that you cover **all** beginner tutorials.

You should also follow the instructions provided in our [introduction to ROS](https://github.com/mas-group/minimal_ros_packages).

[Clearpath's Intro to ROS](http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/ros/Intro%20to%20the%20Robot%20Operating%20System.html) is another good resource to get your concepts clear.

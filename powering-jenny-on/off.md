### Powering jenny ON
To start jenny, follow the steps provided below -
1.  Switch ON the power supply after ensuring that the power supply cable is not attached to jenny.
2.  Turn the current knob until some voltage is displayed then turn the voltage knob until voltage is between the range mentioned on the power supply.
3.  Attach the cable to jenny. The connector can be recognized by its red colour.   
**Note**:  This will cause the voltage to drop. If at any point the voltage drops too low, turn off the power supply and restart from step 1.
4.  Increase the current until voltage is back in the range. 
5.  Turn the key on jenny clockwise (hold for a few seconds then release).
6.  Release the emergency stop. The procedure is listed below.

### Releasing the emergency stop
This procedure is to be performed on the big yellow remote.  
**Note**: Always replace the remote on its charging station after you have finished working on jenny.
1.  Press the big red button.
2.  Pull the big red button back up.
3.  Press the black button (one beside the green button) for few seconds. If done correctly, you will hear a faint click on release.
4.  Turn the key on jenny. Again you should hear a single click. If you do not, perform the procedure again.

After this, you can restart jenny from the console by clicking on the 'recover_all' button on the dashboard followed by 'init_all'. The former must be performed after every emergency stop release while the latter is not required except on starting jenny.
